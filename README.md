# Feature-Selection-on-Life-Expectancy-Data.

The United Nations, in 2019, have estimated the global average life expectancy to be 72.6 years. The growth rate of life expectancy has been significant and after couple of centuries life expectancy is expected to be more than twice as that of our ancestors. However there are global inequalities that can hinder this growth and it is important to identify these factors. To predict and analyse life expectancy this paper uses different regression models that are trained on the Life Expectancy dataset. These models are compared with various metrics. Different models behave distinctly towards the data and learn from various features of the dataset. This work studies the important features used by each model and analyses the trends. The purpose of this project is to find the best features and best regression model to predict the life expectancy of a country.
